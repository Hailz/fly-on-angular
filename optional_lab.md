#Combining Angular and Express

Using the Airplanes API starter, create an Angular CRUD app that does the following.

##Requirements

  * Each airplane should also have an image (will involve altering the Airplane schema)
  * There should be a search bar that can filter the list of airplanes
* Allows creation of new airplanes

##Bonuses

* Instead of displaying every airplane, add pagination to the application
  * This will involve accessing `req.query` and limit/offset
  * This *may* involve altering the search bar
